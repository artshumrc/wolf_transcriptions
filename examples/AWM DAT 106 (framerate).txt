Performer introduces himself as K. Mundan in Shollur Kokal (Kurgōj village), age 60, June 8 1992. He is playing a bamboo trumpet called bugīr. The melodies are sometimes songs but more often koḷs, that is, instrumental pieces also played on the double reed instrument called the koḷ.  Many of these have specific ritual uses and meanings.

00:00:10:19 ticac mog pacd koḷ. (Tune for the grasping of the fire-grasping boy). The tune used to call and lead the people behind the “fire grasping boy” who acts as the lead ritualist during the secondary mortuary ceremony called vardāv (dry funeral). The ritual in which this is played occurs after the biers (chairs holding unburned bone pieces from the original cremation) are burned and all the villagers return to the village. p55, item 1, header, Kota Songs, Bugri (Kgj) (DAT 3) 1.
00:01:43:27  R Wolf asks Mundan to identify the song just played and he does, in Kota and Tamil.
00:02:09:14 man eytr vadd koḷ (Tune for getting clay and returning). This tune is played during the god ceremony when people (formerly women in most cases) return from collecting clay for making new pots as part of that ceremony.  [I probably wrote “formerly” because in some cases the men are concerned about the women being disturbed by male outsiders living nearby and may help out with this ritual]. Note on this entry to compare this tune with similar ones for Ticgāṛ and Kalāc villages, as well as the koḷ in Kolmēl called the Kirpuṭn meyṇ koḷ. p55, item 2, header, Kota Songs, Bugri (Kgj) (DAT 3) 1.
00:03:25:09 Mundan identifies the tune just played.
00:03:44:19 kaberc koḷ (Tune for cutting posts).  This tune is played during the god ceremony season when men go to the forest and collect tree trunks to rebuild the temples.  This is now formalized in ritual as the temples are made of cement and do not need to be rebuilt. p55, item 3, header, Kota Songs, Bugri (Kgj) (DAT 3) 1.
00:05:48:27 Mundan identifies tune just played.
00:06:00:07 tavṭ kōr imbayṭk oygd koḷ (tune for leading buffaloes to high country). Mundan hides the true use of this koḷ, which is to accompany the chasing, catching, and sacrificigng of a buffalo for the varldāv. On another occasion, Mundan referred to the then hidden practice of sacrificing a buffalo as something they are “ashamed” about. p55, item 4, header, Kota Songs, Bugri (Kgj) (DAT 3) 1.
00:07:35:07 Mundan identifies tune just played.
00:07:45:01 ukēr amn koḷ (tune for goddess Ukeramman).  Tune played during worship of goddess Ukeramman, from whom the Kotas of Kurgoj village have built a temple by the tea shops just beyond the edge of the village. p55, item 5, header, Kota Songs, Bugri (Kgj) (DAT 3) 1.
00:09:27:15 Mundan identifies tune just played.
00:09:37:08 dukt koḷ (sad tune). Tune based on the song “en aṇ Caḷo” (my brother Saln)  sung by the younger sister of a man who died in the village of Kalāc.  The song is demonstrated by Mundan’s sister on AWM_DAT_107 part II, 00:56:58:14.  I’ve written a note that this tune is also similar to a Kolmel god tune and in particular Veṭkār Coym (Hunting god) tune in Kolmēl. p55, item 6, header, Kota Songs, Bugri (Kgj) (DAT 3) 1.
00:11:04:25 Mundan and a nearby woman explain the meaning of the tune just played.
00:11:30:01 “Macani ama” (Masani amma [goddess name]). Sung by Kunkayn in Kurgoj village.  Composed by Rajammal of Ticgāṛ village (who was living and composing at the time of this recording). At the time of recording, this was a popular song sung especially when Kotas went down to the intertribal festival in honor of the goddess Macani in Bokkappuram near the town of Masanagudi.  From Kurgoj, the temple is several hours’ walk downhill through a jungle filled with wild animals. p55-56, item 7, header, Kota Songs, Bugri (Kgj) (DAT 3) 1 and (2).
00:15:27:09 dukt koḷ. “sad tune.” Played by K. Mundan on bugīr. p56, item 8, header, Kota Songs, Bugri (Kgj) (DAT 3) (2).
00:18:04:14 amnōr koḷ. (“Tune for the goddess amnōr.”) Played by K. Mundan on bugīr. p56, item 9, header, Kota Songs, Bugri (Kgj) (DAT 3) (2).
00:19:19:19 Mundan identifies piece just played.
00:19:25:10 ayṇōr koḷ. (“Tune for the god ayṇōr.”)  Played by K. Mundan on bugīr. p56, item 10, header, Kota Songs, Bugri (Kgj) (DAT 3) (2).
00:21:22:17 Mundan identifies piece just played.
00:21:30:06 im kātd koḷ (“Tune for guarding the buffaloes)”. Actually im ercd koḷ, for sacrificing buffalo. See also item 4, 00:06:00:07. Played by K. Mundan on bugīr. p56, item 11, header, Kota Songs, Bugri (Kgj) (DAT 3) (2)
00:23:00:15 Mundan identifies piece just played.
00:23:05:13 uṇk tal ēr (“tune for [sacrificing] the male buffalo in the morning [ritual]”). Played by K. Mundan on bugīr. p56, item 12, header, Kota Songs, Bugri (Kgj) (DAT 3) (2)
00:23:53:08 Mundan identifies piece just played and a woman nearby says that on the varldāv ground they cut it in the morning.
00:24:08:14 unexplained appearance of some other popular music.
00:24:42:00 pāṭ, “agādi ima” (don’t cry). Sung by Kunykayn, composed by Kunykayn for her daughter who kept crying for her father (who had died). p57, item 13, header, Kota Songs, Bugri (Kgj) (DAT 3) (3)
00:27:43:13 Kunykayn explains about composing the song she just sang.
00:27:54:07 “Enīṇāna Kunagaro.” (My father Kunagaro) Sung by S. Cindamani, mistakenly using the tune for “Puy avo.” p58, item 14, header, Kota Songs, Bugri (Kgj) (DAT 3) (4)
00:29:22:14 “Oyāde mayēne ocīdma Kunangāro.” Sung by S. Cindamani, almost definitely part of the recording sessions in Kurgoj ending on 8 June 1992. This is the correct tune for the song she tried to sing prior to this. Also found on AWM_DAT_108 00:56:09:11 sung by V. Mathi. p58, item 15, header, Kota Songs, Bugri (Kgj) (DAT 3) (4). p58, item 15, header, Kota Songs, Bugri (Kgj) (DAT 3) (4)
00:30:13:21 pāṭ, “āṛgo ama pāṛgo ama” (dance, sing, girl). Sung by B Mari, composed by B Mari. Most likely after 8 June 1992 and in Kolmel. No date announced. p58, item 16, header, Kota Songs, Bugri (Kgj) (DAT 3) (4).
00:34:02:05 B Mari introduces herself. (She uses the name “Mathi” because most Kota women are named Mathi and then are given a more personalized name). She says that she composed the song for people who consume arrack.  Off tape, she says it was her brother Singan (Cindamani’s husband) who actually inspired the song.
00:34:12:14 pāṭ, “Kōkāle gaṇḍelm ōriḍumege, oḏ ēlve aṛdkēne” (Village men listen, I’ll tell you one matter). p59, item 17, header, Kota Songs, Bugri (Kgj) (DAT 3) (5).
00:38:45:11 B Mari introduces herself and said she composed this “naṛjāyne” song, this hand clapping song.  The class of songs called god songs (devr pāṭ) include several special ones (possibly older than others), one of which is called naṛjāyne (onomatopoeia for the sound of ankle bells).  Sometimes that particular song name is used metonymically for the whole class of songs in which women clap their hands and dance.  The song Mari sings mentions both the word naṛjāyne and the act of clapping hands.
00:38:49:27 pāṭ, “kay taṭume kay taṭume naṛjāyne irre” (clapping hands, saying ‘naṛyāyne). Sung by B Mari, composed by B Mari. p59-60, item 18, header, Kota Songs, Bugri (Kgj) (DAT 3) (5) and (6).
00:41:47:17 S Cindamani introduces herself in a very serious voice (which is funny because the song she is about to sing is entirely playful). “I am Cindamani, Kurgoj village, daughter of Kabaln, sing.” This sounds as if it is recorded in Kurgoj, but she is referring to being the daughter of Kabaln, and that is the subject of the song she is about to sing, so I think she is referring to her home village and not where she is singing the song, which is probably in Kolmēl.
00:41:56:25 pāṭ, “ān kabalīṇ mōḷe karcirēne” (I am Kabal’s daughter, laughing). Sung by S Cindamani, composed by S Cindamani. p 60-61, item 19, header, Kota Songs, Bugri (Kgj) (DAT 3) (6) and (7).
00:46:19:07 R Wolf asked Cindamani when she composed the previous song. She says “the day before yesterday” and laughs.
00:46:26:09 āṭḷ, “enavā enakōmo mādy” (my mother, what to say? Mathi). Sung by Cindamani, composed by Cindamani. This sounds like it is a mourning song for the mother of her husband Singan, and it also mentions Mari. It says that Singan wanted a younger sister, so the mother made an offering to Mariyamman (goddess) at Kurgoj village and then gave birth to the girl they called Mari. It mentions Singan’s heavy drinking and (Cindamani’s) perception of Mari conducting herself “differently” and not speaking with her. Mari and her husband were upwardly mobile and might have been seen by Cindamani and others as looking down upon them.  Even though this was a song of sadness and complaint, Cindamani can be heard quietly laughing in the background afterward. p 61-62, item 20, header, Kota Songs, Bugri (Kgj) (DAT 3) (7) and (8).

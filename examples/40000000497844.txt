47:27 Porgāṛ devr

Background: This is the village close to the modern town of Kotagiri. Originally the village was located in what is now a park in the center of town. The British wanted the Kotas to use toilets in their villages and they refused, saying that the smells were offensive to their gods. They moved to another place called Āgāl, where they lived until an earthquake destroyed it; then the government set them up in their current village. They are the most “modern” of Kota villages but at the same time think of themselves as the most conservative. For that reason they would not allow me to be present on the nights of the temple opening ceremony—they distinguished themselves from Kolmel, where I lived, saying that they would never allow a non-Kota to live there, nor be present during certain ceremonies. From the perspective of some of the other villages, the people of Porgāṛ have been made to suffer ever since they left their home village location. The god ceremony in the current village includes (or at least used to) a formal return to the old site of the village.

Two of the koḷ players were Jayachandran (who was at that time living outside the village, but who worked on his koḷ playing on his own, and learned some pieces from Puccan in Kolmel, his father-in-law) and a man who went by the nickname Pūkali (not considered a particularly good player). One of the tabaṭk players was Magali, Jaychandran’s grandfather, and he played well (note above—interview with Magali)


47:31 I narrate that we are sitting around the guḷm (name of area near temple where fire is kept in Porgāṛ village) on the fourth night of the ceremony (Thursday).

time stamp: jan 9, 6:50:48 p.m.

I ask which temple is amnor and which is aynor and someone answers “the lower one is aynor the upper one is amnor,” but only one is visible to the camera, and it is very dark

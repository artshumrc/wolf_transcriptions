Baderi, Wynad District, Kerala, March 12, 1992

(actually the recording begins late at night, so on the morning of March 13, 1992. See time stamp info below)

I remember this as pronounced baḍēri, but I cannot find it on a map. It might well have been battēri, short for Sultan’s Battery or Sulthan Bathery, which is a prominent town down the road (Sultan’s Battery road) from Bitherkard, just after entering Wynad district of Kerala:

11°39’46.49”N
76°15’25.28”E

The audio tape corresponding to this event is AWM DAT at  115 01:02:37:22

Note below, where I mention one of the ceṇḍa drums that is leading, providing the bass, it is probably called the vīkkan ceṇḍa.

 [00:00:09.16] Beginning.  Possessed man with a crooked stick stumbles into the crowd. The sound of a double reed from one of the tribal groups present can be heard.

[00:00:22.01] closeup of (probably) priest in temple with thatched roof. It is early morning 

[00:00:36.06] Paniya music and dance (in the dark)

[00:01:02.05] Possessed man with crooked stick speaking to Paniya woman (probably giving advice, as the deity)

[00:01:21.03] possessed man holds out hand for money

[00:01:33.16] Paniya women dancing

[00:01:41.17] time stamp: March 13, 1992, 4:19:35 a.m.

(Note that the corresponding audio begins at about 2:30 a.m.)

men seen in a separate circle, moving counterclockwise, dancing and playing their instruments and crying out 

[00:02:59.23] other views of the same, following the last tune

[00:03:29.17] light illuminates female Paniya dancers

[00:05:19.21] The next Teyyam performer/possessee gets outfitted in his costume

[00:05:38.18] Later in the process of costuming dancer. Date and time stamp: March 13, 1992, 6:09:06 a.m. 

[00:05:43.02] View of Kariayattai amman temple

[00:05:53.05] Pan to left, starting with trees, then surrounding grounds and a few Kāṭṭu Nāyakkars dancing.

[00:06:14.28] First I show the area where the Kāṭṭu Nāyakkars occupy and dance (closer to the temple), and then the place for Paṇiyas (further back away from the temple)

[00:06:26.14] Paṇiyas dancing in their area

[00:06:40.07] Cut to costumed dancer. The wooden structure is still being assembled/dressed on him; still in dark. Announcement on loudspeaker.

[00:06:51.25] Paṇiyas dancing

[00:07:21.01] sunrise, with film music on the loudspeaker

[00:07:32.27] musicians playing before fully costumed dancer, while one person incants. Another person comes to put vibhuti (ashes; or could be some other white substance) on the dancer. Dancer’s legs begins to shake

[00:08:28.18] dancer gazes at himself in the mirror. Through this act of vision, he sees himself as the deity and becomes further possessed.

[00:08:35.22] dancer holds two crossed sticks with flames (candles?)

[00:08:54.27] Cut to dancer upright and spinning, all to the accompaniment of ceṇḍai drumming

[00:09:05.28] Dancer can be heard emitting high pitched sounds; his footfalls correspond precisely with the bass strokes of the drum; The drummers lead his movements and there are 2 men helping him walk (the costume is heavy, for one, and perhaps being possessed presents the possibility of falling).

[00:09:15.04] Local tribals and other people who have come to get advice from the goddess stand at the edge of the temple arena, called a kṣetram, waiting for the possessed dancer to approach them.

[00:09:21.19] Dancer steps, with helpers, as drummers lead; circumambulating temple clockwise.

[00:10:56.07] Teyyam dancer in front of temple, spinning between the temple and the stool (pīṭham). Then stepping elsewhere with circular motions, the drums increasing in speed and dancers steps quickening in time. 

[00:12:17.15]  March 13, 1992 6:52:59 a.m.

Very fast movements, running across to edge of kṣetram and back. Good shots of drummers and onlookers

[00:13:17.17] Dancer gets on top of pīṭham and the two helpers join their fire sticks in front of the dancer

[00:14:24.09] zoom in to dancer on pīṭham, who is spinning one direction followed by the other. The bass drum beats out a pattern that is also maintained by the dancer on the pīṭham

[00:15:09.29] dancer steps around pīṭham, making an inward-facing triangle with the two helpers; then moves to other locations and circles similarly

[00:15:44.29] Cut to dancer moving on his own accord.

[00:16:57.16] A man is shouting “oh oh oh oh” to the dancer

[00:17:16.19] dancer is now holding sword and shield

[00:17:29.19] Dancer now wearing a headdress of peacock feathers covered with a black canopy and stepping in a 2 + 3 (5 beat) pattern along with the bass drum part, holding a crooked sword, almost as if it is a cane (is he representing an old man?)

[00:17:46.16] now the 5 beat pattern is made into a 10 beat pattern by alternating damped and open stroke versions of the same pattern

[00:18:26.22] cut to dancer shaking, different drum pattern, and two men behind him shouting to him

[00:19:25.23] Teyyam dancer approaches the men who had been shouting behind him, and speaks to them as the deity.

[00:19:43.04] another perspective on same, dancers words reasonably clear

[00:19:56.13] now he speaks to a Paṇiya woman

[00:20:28.12] Cut to scene of Paṇiya women near the temple. One of the women looks like she is overcome with emotion/possession (she is not dressed like the other Paniya women, so I’m not sure if she is Paniya).  The sound of the bass drum can be heard repeating a patter in the background. Later there is a closer view of some kind of boxes with handles on a shelf/platform part of the temple, and the women are taking a pinch of something from a plate or leaf (can’t see). Could be ash or kumkumam. We don’t see what it is here.

[00:21:38.04] The possessed dancer speaks to some other devotees—apparently Paniya men and women but may be others as well.

[00:22:10.26] cut to back of Teyyam dancer, who faces temple as the drums are playing. He turns toward the onlookers and this time is holding the crooked sword, again possibly like a cane—but he doesn’t have the frond headdress.

[00:22:45.26] bends over for items (powder? water vessel?) next to lamp, right beside pīṭham

[00:22:53.11] another view, showing drummers and onlookers; a person next to temple also handles the items by the pīṭham and the Teyyam dancer gives him something or holds his hand afterward. Teyyam dancer emits high pitched sound and drops what he had in his hand—maybe a conch.  Remaining in his hand is what looks like a coconut with the shell removed. The crooked sword looks even more like a cane now, as the dancer leans on it as if limping what walking.

[00:23:30.28] Teyyam dancer empties coconut water at the base of a tree and limps back toward temple, then throws coconut into the air, and it falls in two pieces before the temple

[00:24:10.05] One of the musicians walks over and puts the coconut under the pīṭham

[00:24:12.27] In the leaf canopy used as a green room, the makeup artist prepares the face paint for the next dancer. I ask what the dance is called and they say “Panjagayampodu”
“Kuchayyam.” Then they think I have asked the name of the person being made up, and it is Sashi. Then I say, what is the god’s name. The painter says Veḷḷumśaru but the other guy next to him says no (maybe they are disagreeing about what I’m asking). Then they both say Muḍikāḍandadēvati. Karamuttare (?)

So I say, this dance is Muḍikārantaveḷi (that’s how I heard it and they don’t correct me). Then they say, that is the first dance.

Then I said, “But that guy, he was Kariyattai”; then the two said, that one is finished. So I asked, like that, which god is this. The painter said “Mudiyan”

[00:25:15.16] man with brass vessel sprinkling water or something. I say “this is Bhagvati”  and the man puts the brass vessel at the foot of a tree.

[00:25:28.24] men are building some kind of ritual structure-a square with leaves and flowers. video follows through and shows onlookers. Looks also like food is being served from a basket.

[00:25:48.15] ceṇḍa players begin slowly, once again; fire cracker goes off a bit in the distance; and a kāṭṭu nāyakka playing a kuḻal player is heard warming up (and seen behind the ceṇḍa drummers; then the kuḻal player and drummer stand up). As the ceṇḍa drummers settle into a pattern/composition (still slow), in the foreground the men continue to make ritual preparations using banana leaves and other substances. Not yet clear what this is for. Could be connected with the next costume.

[00:27:10.12] cut to new stage in the process of preparing banana leaf arrangement; ceṇḍa drummers now playing faster. Rice is put on the banana leaves

[00:27:34.23] cut to later stage, where each of 7 banana leaves has rice and a coconut, and a candle or other firestick

[00:28:00.20] Cut to next dancer, dressed in red below waist and red head covering. Torso bare, covered with yellow paste. Holding curved sword. Pan to right, then back left to the banana leaf/food arrangement. I note that the open parts of the square in the center of the banana leaves are facing east and west.

[00:28:24.09] Men behind the new dancer start to shout behind him: Oh…. wa wa wa wa, oh…… wa wa wa wa. He stands with sword pointed up and gradually starts to shake; as the drumming gets more animated he starts moving in a more exaggerated way and then starts hopping, with his hands flailing,, toward the tree in front of him (where various rituals had taken place, evidence of which lies within the stone ring around the tree.

[00:29:11.27] Possessed Paṇiya women appears, hopping with arms flailing, from behind tree. She is kept from getting too close to Teyyam dancer. then a firecracker goes off. Then a male onlooker also gets possessed and he is helped and restrained. The movements of all start to become regularized and align with the beat of the drums

[00:30:05.12] Now the more elaborately costumed Teyyam dancer appears after having rounded the temple. He has a large dew-drop shaped wood and cloth structure attached to his back and extending above his head. The less elaborately dressed guy leads him by the hand

[00:30:27.27] The new, heavily costumed dancer steps on the pīṭham and executes steps from there, then steps down and dances facing the temple, then turns toward onlookers and continues to spin slowly, then approaches onlookers

[00:31:48.13] cut to a new groove/set of steps; same dancer

[00:32:40.24] cut to new angle on same dancer, with drummers visible

[00:33:37.28] Pan showing onlookers at edge of kṣetram, past drummers, to dancer. then cut to new section of dance

[00:34:21.08] dancer carrying a leaf with something on it, and a man catches his arm and talks to him. A third party in dark red mediates. Dancer puts a substance on the first man’s forehead and moves on; sprinkles something from leaf onto ground before onlookers (I can’t see anything actually falling to ground); he does this in several places

[00:34:57.18] cut to active dance/spinning, hopping

[00:35:32.08] dancer approaches another man, applies substance to his forehead, and emits high pitched sound

[00:36:06.27] Kāṭṭu Nāyakas can be seen dancing in this shot. The Teyyam dancer has gone outside the kṣetra and is right next to the Kurumba dancers/musicians. The guy in dark red who mediated earlier is now putting a substance on dancer’s forehead

[00:36:35.12] cut to dancer running by again, hopping with great energy and spinning. Then he throws whatever he is holding in both of his hands into the air.

[00:37:19.00] brief closeup on Paṇiya woman’s earring.

[00:37:37.28] one ceṇḍa drummer fills the camera frame, then zooms out to two drummers and a cymbal player

[00:37:55.05] cut to Teyyam dancer moving at a good clip with hands holding bunches of plants

[00:38:14.03] dancer stands before pīṭham and someone brings water for him to wash his hands

[00:38:32.25] dancer takes a staff and goes before temple, then comes out in the open again, with another item in his other hand 

[00:38:56.21] I ask what this dance is (I think), but I can’t make out the response.

[00:38:58.22] First someone sets up the standing dancer with something in his hands, then the dancer speaks as the god, giving advice to one of the standers by.  His face and speech are clear.

[00:39:35.00] cut to someone pounding a chisel and the drummers standing to side

[00:39:40.14] back to dancer, stepping deliberately to bass strokes at longish intervals, then the strokes fill in and his motions increase; then the sequence repeats at another location

[00:40:48.12] I say “this is a new dance”

[00:41:29.23] video ends
